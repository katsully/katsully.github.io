What is an object?
	collection of properties and methods

Think of a car, a car is an object w/ properties like weight and color and methods start stop
	ask for examples
	all cars have these properties, but the values diff car to car
	all cars have these functions but they happen at diff times

objects are variables too (just like the x)

var car = {type: "Honda", model: "500", color:"white"}

you can access property values in 2 ways
	car.type
	car["type"]

jump to week 5!

	we can define object type by creating a function for the object type that specifies its name, properties and methods

	a method is a function associated w/ an object
		a method is a property of an object that is a function

back to week 4
	describe arrays
	make array of objects
	go over for loops

	for(var i=0; i<array.lenght; i++) {
		doSomething
	}

	make a bunch of bubbles with random x, y, r, b, g
